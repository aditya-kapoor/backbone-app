Welcome to the backbone-api where the intention is to use BackboneJS to its fullest extent.

## Features:

* I have used the Rails App mainly as the backend support system which will spit out plain old JSON
* Backbone-on-rails gem have been used here which kind of mixes well with the Rails
* You, can alternatively use the js file of backbone and run on some other port like 80 and make the Backbone app make requests to the rails server usaully running on port 3000. CORS support needs to be enabled for that.

## TODO:
* Implement the router support
* Replace Rails with Sinatra or Rails API as current Rails app is a full-blown app which come with a lot of excess baggage
* App optimizations + Syntax improvements (make it more like Rails style)
* Support for the nested routes
* Implement Twitter Bootstrap along with NodeJS (Advanced Usage)
